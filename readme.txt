== Description ==
This is a very simple plugin that adds an add to digg button (as you can see on this site). It adds a link and image of the form http://digg.com/submit/?url=$permalink.

== Installation ==
1.  Add a directory called add-to-digg to /wp-content/plugins/ and unzip the files there.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress, click settings to change options.

== Add to template tag ==
 If you set Add to Digg to appear under template tags instead of automatically, you will need to add the following code to a post.
`<?php if(function_exists(addtofacebook)) : addtofacebook(); endif; ?>`
